# R-Programming
This repository contains scripts used for statistics & probability theory, as well as the mathematical basics (in German).
<li>
<ul>Mathematik f√ºr Wirtschaftsinformatiker II.pdf: Contains the basics about single variable and multi variable calculus applied to an economic background and guides on how to solve specific problems using Maple CAS</ul>
<ul>Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie & Statistik.pdf: Contains the basics about descriptive and inductive statistics and probability theory and guides on how to solve specific problems using the R language</ul>
<ul>confidence-interval.R: Contains the code for a function calculating the boundaries of a confidence interval, given the sample size, the parameters of the normal distribution and the wanted confidence level</ul>
<ul>get-mode.R: Contains the code for a function calculating the mode of a given vector</ul>
<ul>maximum-likelihood.R: Contains the code for maximum likelihood estimation used for machine learning for a given vector and a distribution, albeit only the normal distribution, the Poisson distribution, the exponential distribution and the binomial distribution are implemented.</ul>
<ul>t-standardization.R: Contains the code for a function for standardizing a given vector, the mean of the null hypothesis is needed</ul>
